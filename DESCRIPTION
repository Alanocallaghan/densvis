Description: 
  Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE described by
  Narayan et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.05.12.077776>.
  This modification includes a term which considers the local density of points
  in the original high-dimensional space when creating the t-SNE embedding.
  This can help to create visualisations that are more representative of
  heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.
