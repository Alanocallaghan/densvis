Description: 
  Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE 
  and UMAP described by Narayan et al. (2020) 
  <doi:10.1101/2020.05.12.077776>.
  The non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques t-SNE and UMAP
  enable users to summarise complex high-dimensional manifolds into
  lower dimensional states. In some cases, this results in
  misleading visualisations, where the density of points in the low-dimensional
  embedding does not represent the diversity or heterogeneity in the original
  high-dimensional space. den-SNE and densMAP aim to enable more accurate 
  visual interpretation of high-dimensional datasets by producing 
  lower-dimensional embeddings that accurately represent the heterogeneity of 
  the original high-dimensional space.
  This is accomplished by including in the optimisation process a term which 
  considers the local density of points in the original high-dimensional space.
  This can help to create visualisations that are more representative of 
  heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.
